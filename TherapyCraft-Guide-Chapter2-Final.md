# Chapter 2: Building Your Technical Setup

## Part 1: What You're Building (The Big Picture)

Before diving into the details, let's understand what you're creating: a secure, professional virtual therapy space that exists entirely within Minecraft. This isn't just "playing games with kids"—it's a carefully structured therapeutic environment with built-in safety measures.

### Your Investment Breakdown

**Time Investment:**
- Initial setup: One focused afternoon (3-4 hours)
- Learning curve: 2-3 weeks to feel comfortable
- Mastery: Within a month, this will be second nature

**Financial Investment:**
- Minecraft Bedrock Edition: $29.99 (one-time)
- Monthly Realms: Starting at $3.99/month
- Optional but recommended: Basic gaming laptop ($600-800)
- Total first month: Under $35

**Return on Investment:**
If you charge $150-250 per specialized session, your entire technical setup pays for itself with your first client. A gaming laptop pays for itself in 3-5 sessions. Parents are incredibly receptive to this modality—you'll likely fill these slots quickly.

### Why This Specific Setup Matters

We use Realms instead of regular multiplayer worlds for critical reasons:
- **Privacy**: In regular multiplayer, clients could potentially see each other's builds or accidentally destroy someone else's work
- **Control**: You decide exactly when clients can access the space (only during their session)
- **Security**: Clients can never enter when you're not there
- **Simplicity**: No need for complex permissions or protection systems that can get complicated

## Part 2: Purchase and Account Setup

### Purchasing Minecraft

Go to Minecraft.net, click the Buy Now button in the header, and select **Minecraft: Java and Bedrock Edition → PC**. This is a one-time cost of $29.99. Skip the "Deluxe" version—you don't need any of those add-ons.

**Critical Mac Warning:**
Realms do not run on Mac. If you're on a Mac, you'll only be able to purchase the Java Edition, which does not support cross-platform play or Realms. For TherapyCraft, you'll need to use a Windows PC.

### Which Version Do You Need?

| Version | Works for TherapyCraft? | Why/Why Not |
|---------|------------------------|-------------|
| **Bedrock Edition** | YES | Cross-platform compatible, supports Realms, works with all devices |
| **Java Edition** | NO | PC/Mac only, no Realms support, no cross-platform play |
| **Education Edition** | NO | Requires school licenses, too limited for therapy use |

### Setting Up Your Microsoft Account

Once Minecraft finishes downloading (be patient—it can take a while, especially if Windows needs updates), you'll be prompted to Sign in or Sign Up for a Microsoft Account. 

I recommend creating a new account specifically for therapy. Keep it completely separate from personal accounts.

### Choosing Your Gamertag (Critical for HIPAA)

Your Gamertag is what clients see in the game. This choice matters for confidentiality:

| Good Gamertags | Bad Gamertags | Why It Matters |
|----------------|---------------|----------------|
| StoneRiver28 | TherapistAshley | Identifies your profession |
| SkyGarden34 | DrJangroMC | Contains your real name |
| BlueMountain7 | CastleRockLPCC | Reveals location/credentials |

**Remember:** Clients' friends can potentially see their friends list. A neutral gamertag protects everyone's privacy.

### Privacy Settings (Non-Negotiable)

**What happens if you skip this step?**
Clients could see each other's gamertags through your friends list, violating confidentiality.

**How to fix it:**
1. Click your profile icon (top-right corner)
2. Select Settings
3. Navigate to Privacy & online safety
4. Under "Others can see your friends list," change to **Only me**
   - NOT "Friends only"—must be "Only me"
5. Review all other privacy options, such as hiding your real name and limiting who can contact you

## Part 3: Understanding Realms (Your Virtual Office)

### The Building and Office Metaphor

Think of it this way:

**REALM = Your Practice Building** ($3.99/month)
- Permanent rental, can't be repurposed
- Houses up to 3 offices
- Named neutrally: "Realm A" or "Monday Sessions"

**WORLDS = Individual Therapy Offices** (3 per Realm)
- Can be completely renovated between clients
- Where actual therapy happens
- Can be reset, deleted, or rebuilt as needed

### Why We Use Realms Instead of Regular Multiplayer

Regular multiplayer worlds create several problems:
- Clients could see each other's builds and discover who else you work with
- One client could accidentally or intentionally destroy another's creations
- You'd have to be online for clients to access the world
- There are advanced protection systems, but they get complicated quickly

Realms solve all these issues with simple, built-in privacy controls.

### Getting the $3.99 Realm (Not $7.99)

**Don't click "Create Realm" first—that only shows the $7.99 option!**

Instead, follow these exact steps:
1. Open Minecraft → Play → Create New World
2. Set it to Creative mode and turn off Multiplayer
3. Name it something neutral (you'll rename later if needed)
4. Save & Quit
5. Back on the Worlds tab, click Manage → Convert to Realm
6. NOW you'll see the $3.99/month Realm option. Select it.

### Understanding Your Realm Capacity

With one $29.99 Minecraft purchase, you get:

| Realm Type | How Many Available | Worlds per Realm | Total Client Capacity |
|------------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| $3.99 Realms | Up to 3 | 3 worlds each | 9 clients total |
| $7.99 Realms | Up to 3 more | 3 worlds each | 18 more clients |

Each $3.99 Realm allows for you + one client in session. You are allowed up to 3 worlds live inside this one realm (only one world can be active at a time).

Most therapists start with one $3.99 Realm and expand as needed. If you need more than 18 total clients, you'll have to purchase a new $29.99 Minecraft game and create a second Microsoft login.

## Part 4: Session Setup and Management

### Using a Realm During Sessions

**Pre-Session (First 15 minutes):**
1. Start your video call or in-person session
2. Do check-in and goal setting
3. Keep Minecraft closed so client isn't distracted

**Opening the Realm (After check-in):**
1. Open Minecraft on your computer
2. Navigate to the Realms tab
3. Select the realm for that client
4. Navigate to Settings, then Advanced, and turn the realm ON
5. Leave the settings tab and navigate to that client's world

This allows for you to have a check-in period to set goals before your client is off to the races.

**Post-Session (Immediately after):**
1. Exit the world
2. Navigate again to Settings, then Advanced
3. **Close** the realm
4. This prevents the client from entering the realm outside of their designated session time

### Important World Settings

When you create a new World inside a Realm, you'll see options that control how the game behaves. Most of these can be adjusted later, but there's one big exception: **cheats**.

| Setting | My Recommendation | Can Change Later? | Why It Matters |
|---------|------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Cheats** | ON | NO - locked at creation | Gives you flexibility for therapeutic interventions |
| **PVP (Player vs Player)** | OFF | Yes | Prevents clients from harming each other |
| **Sleep Rules** | One player sleeps | Yes | Allows you to skip night without both sleeping |
| **Hostile Mobs** | OFF for anxious clients | Yes | Reduces stress and distractions |
| **Always Daylight** | ON for anxious clients | Yes | Prevents darkness-related anxiety |

I generally leave most settings at their defaults, but it's worth taking a quick look when you create a World. If a client has specific needs (like high anxiety around monsters or darkness), you can adjust these upfront to create a calmer play space.

### Creative vs. Survival Mode

| Creative Mode | Survival Mode |
|--------------|---------------|
| **Experience:** Calm, safe, unlimited possibilities | **Experience:** Challenging, emotional, real-time practice |
| No danger, no death, no pressure | Players gather resources, craft tools, and face danger |
| Access to every block and item in the game | Risk and unpredictability lead to natural emotional reactions |
| Fly, build instantly, break blocks in one tap | Consequences make success and persistence more meaningful |
| Functions like a digital sandbox | Realistic physics and limitations |
| **Best for:** Anxious clients, symbolic play, building rapport | **Best for:** Frustration tolerance, problem-solving, resilience building |
| **Therapeutic Uses:** "Show me what sadness looks like" | **Therapeutic Uses:** "Can we build shelter before nightfall?" |

Most kids already know what they prefer, so it's often best to ask them. I personally use Survival Mode most often, since that's what kids tend to choose. But for some children, especially those who play mainly for building or therapists who are new to Minecraft, Creative Mode is a perfect starting point.

**You can switch between modes anytime in Realm settings.** That means you can start in Creative to build safety and trust, then switch to Survival once a client is ready for healthy challenge.

Remember: Survival Mode should only be used when clients have enough regulation skills to handle it. Some sessions will still need the safety of Creative, and that's okay. As the therapist, you can also 'co-regulate' by playing alongside your client, modeling calm responses, and guiding reflection in the moment.

## Part 5: Scaling and Business Considerations

### When to Add More Realms

At first, $3.99 Realms are all you'll need. But eventually, you may fill those 9 office spaces and need more. Minecraft allows you to purchase three more Realms at a $7.99 price point. These Realms allow for you + 10 other players at a time. However, you will only ever use them for you + one client at a time due to HIPAA practices (unless you were managing a group session which is not covered in this guide).

### Pricing Considerations

Though you can decide what's best for your practice, I do not pass these costs onto the client. I simply account for them when pricing my TherapyCraft sessions. I typically charge between $150-$250 a session (price varies due to sliding scale) and I consider the cost to pay for a realm included in that pricing.

### Equipment Recommendation

Consider investing in a basic gaming laptop (around $600-800). Here's why:
- Keyboard and mouse give you much better control than controllers
- Easier to manage video platform and Minecraft on same device
- Tax-deductible business expense
- Pays for itself in 3-5 sessions at standard TherapyCraft rates

Personal note: I found laptop controls (WASD keys) much easier than joysticks once I got used to them. You have much more precise control over movement and building.

## Part 6: Common First-Session Troubleshooting

| Problem | Most Likely Solution |
|---------|---------------------|
| "Can't find the Realm" | Check friend requests—make sure you accepted each other |
| "Says I need to update" | Both players need to update Minecraft to same version |
| "Client can't join" | Make sure you turned the Realm ON in settings first |
| "Wrong Microsoft account" | Parents often have multiple accounts—verify which owns Minecraft |
| "Connection issues" | Internet connectivity problem 90% of the time—have them restart |

## You've Got This

Setting all this up takes time—usually a full afternoon when you're focused. But here's what I want you to know: every therapist who implements TherapyCraft goes through this same process. You'll feel overwhelmed at first. The Microsoft account system will be confusing. You'll probably mess up a privacy setting and have to fix it.

That's all normal.

Within a few weeks, you'll be navigating these systems without even thinking about it. Within a month, you'll wonder why it ever seemed complicated. And the first time a silent client suddenly won't stop talking because they're teaching you how to build a redstone door? You'll forget all about the technical setup hassles.

The investment—both time and money—is minimal compared to the therapeutic breakthroughs you'll witness. Trust the process, be patient with yourself, and remember: your clients will be incredibly patient with you as you learn. They're used to adults not understanding technology, and they love being the experts for once.
